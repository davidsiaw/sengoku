There are infinitely many primes

There are infinitely many twin primes

P = NP

Infinite simple groups are simple algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields.

The Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part 0.5.

Every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.

If you take any positive integer and repeatedly divide it by two when its even and triple it and add one when it is odd, it will eventually become 1.
