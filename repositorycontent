There are infinitely many primes

There are infinitely many? a large number? between a and b? twin primes

P = NP <- are we sure?

Infinite simple groups are simple algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields.

The Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part 0.5. <- cant find counterexample, but cant prove that counterexample does not exist

Every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.

If you take any positive integer and repeatedly divide it by two when its even or triple it and add one when it is odd, it will eventually become 1.
